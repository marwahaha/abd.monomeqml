# 40h (2006-2007)

8×8, green LEDs, black silicone enclosure, edge-exposed aluminum plate. exposed ADC ports internally, could be used for tilt as a user modification.

# 40h special edition (2007)

8×8, orange LEDs, various colored enclosures, powercoated white top plates, built-in tilt sensor. 16 units made.

# 40h kit (2007-2010)

8×8, DIY soldered kit.

# “series” 256, 128, 64 (2007-2010)

smaller keypads than the 40h. mitred-frame walnut enclosure, plate embedded/framed within enclosure, orange LEDs. rubber “noodle” slip guard on bottom. burned brand “monome” on bottom. 256 and 128 shipped with external power supply. bus power upgrade offered later. 64 bus powered and included tilt sensor. 256 and 128 not tilt upgradeable.

# grayscale 64, 128 (2010-2012)

white LEDs, silicone over steel enclosure, framed aluminum plate. tilt sensor. bus powered.

# monome kit aka mk (2010)

modular grid kit, logic board supported 8×8, 8×16, or 16×16. 40h keypad size.

# 2011 grids

solid-block milled walnut enclosures, plate embedded. 4-step per-LED variable brightness introduced (slightly buggy– minor flickering on some units.) orange LEDs. tilt upgrade offered later. all bus powered. standard usb plug.

# 2011 arcs

solid-block milled walnut enclosures, plate embedded. orange LEDs. bournes encoders (have slight wobble due to manufacturers tolerances), which are 256 steps per revolution, include key-press per encoder. bus powered. standard usb plug.

# 2012 grids

solid-block milled walnut enclosures, half-height of 2011 model. edge-exposed aluminum plate. yellow-orange LEDs, improved LED circuitry with 16-step variable brightness per LED. new tilt circuitry with 3 axis and much higher resolution. bus powered. mini-usb.

# 2012 arc

solid-block milled walnut enclosures, half-height of 2011 model. edge-exposed aluminum plate. yellow-orange LEDs, improved LED circuitry. new completely custom encoder assembly with no wobble, 1024 steps per revolution, no key-press. bus powered. mini-usb.
