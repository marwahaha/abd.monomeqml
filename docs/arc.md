Arc <2012 had a push button
---------------------------

From tehn:

> edition came about due to the decision to build around the bournes
> EM14 part, as multiple attempts to design our own pushbutton encoder
> resulted in extremely expensive solutions.

> has a tendency to fail on some units after sustained use-- shaft oil
> somehow gets down under the button and shorts it out. of course this
> only happens to a small percentage, but the repair costs involved and
> just overall inconvenience to everybody (especially us) is not
> sustainable. furthermore, the axial tolerance of the EM14 isn't
> great-- some units feel a bit wobbly.

> personally grown to not like using the pushbuttons-- it's impossible
> to register only a press without triggering some rotation-- which to
> me lends itself to modes of interaction which are accomplishable via
> other means. for example, the pushbutton changing rotation speed could
> be better accomplished with acceleration. of course this is an
> oversimplification and there will be cases where the pushbutton was
> very very useful, but i simply didn't have a sensible method to
> continue making arcs with pushbuttons.
